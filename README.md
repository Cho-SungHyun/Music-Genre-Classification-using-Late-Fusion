### 🏆 Key Research 1: Comprehensive Survey & Late Fusion Excellence
**"A Short Survey and Comparison of CNN-Based Music Genre Classification Using Multiple Spectral Features"**
*Published in **IEEE Access (Vol. 12, 2024)***

- **Objective:** To validate the superiority of **Late Fusion** strategies over existing CNN models.
- **Large-Scale Benchmark:** Conducted an empirical study on **12 public datasets** (including Ballroom, ISMIR04, and GTZAN).
- **Outcome:** The devised Late Fusion CNN outperformed all compared methods, proving that fusing high-level feature maps from parallel branches is more effective for acoustic signal processing.

### 💡 Why this is relevant for Scalable ML:
My research in **Late Fusion** is directly applicable to real-world challenges where decision-making requires integrating **heterogeneous data sources** (e.g., combining user metadata with behavioral signals in Ad-Tech). Managing 12+ datasets also demonstrates my ability to handle complex data pipelines and ensure model performance at scale.
